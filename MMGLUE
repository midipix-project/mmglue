this repository contains the midipix architecture- and target-specific
files for musl libc (musl-libc.org).

the midipix musl port does not require any changes to upstream source files,
and has all files under the appropriate architecture-specific directories.

in order to ease development by way of out-of-tree builds, this project
currently uses 'lazy' as its build system. 'lazy' is deviant and somehow
slower than standard make files, but nonetheless gets the job done.

building requires a combined source tree (musl+mmglue) together with lazy,
and of course also the midipix toolchain.

to get lazy, git clone git://midipix.org/lazy;
